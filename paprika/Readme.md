Enough tee? Well, here, cyber some veggies!

The flag you are looking for is the one in the notes/ directory.

To spawn your instance for 5 minutes, connect to hitme.tasteless.eu:10901 and submit your proof of work. Once your instance has booted, you can connect to it:

nc hitme.tasteless.eu 10902 Since this takes a lot of resources, the proof of work is a bit harder. You can also only have one instance per source IP.

You can go grab a VM image at http://hitme.tasteless.eu:10903/paprika.qcow2. You can log into that with root:root.
